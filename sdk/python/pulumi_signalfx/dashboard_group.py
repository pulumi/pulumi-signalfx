        In the SignalFx web UI, a [dashboard group](https://developers.signalfx.com/dashboard_groups_reference.html) is a collection of dashboards.

        > **NOTE** Dashboard groups cannot be accessed directly, but just via a dashboard contained in them. This is the reason why make show won't show any of yours dashboard groups.

        ## Example Usage



        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_signalfx as signalfx

        mydashboardgroup0 = signalfx.DashboardGroup("mydashboardgroup0",
            description="Cool dashboard group",
            authorized_writer_teams=[signalfx_team["mycoolteam"]["id"]],
            authorized_writer_users=["abc123"])
        ```

        ## Example Usage With Mirrored Dashboards

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_signalfx as signalfx

        mydashboardgroup_withmirrors = signalfx.DashboardGroup("mydashboardgroupWithmirrors",
