 * Use this data source to get a list of AWS service names.

 * 
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as signalfx from "@pulumi/signalfx";
 * 
 * const awsServices = signalfx.getAwsServices({});
 * // Leaves out most of the integration bits, see the docs
 * // for signalfx.aws.Integration for more
 * const awsMyteam = new signalfx.aws.Integration("awsMyteam", {services: [awsServices.then(awsServices => awsServices.services)].map(__item => __item?.name)});
 * ```
