/**
 * In the SignalFx web UI, a [dashboard group](https://developers.signalfx.com/dashboard_groups_reference.html) is a collection of dashboards.
 *
 * > **NOTE** Dashboard groups cannot be accessed directly, but just via a dashboard contained in them. This is the reason why make show won't show any of yours dashboard groups.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as signalfx from "@pulumi/signalfx";
 *
 * const mydashboardgroup0 = new signalfx.DashboardGroup("mydashboardgroup0", {
 *     description: "Cool dashboard group",
 *     authorizedWriterTeams: [signalfx_team.mycoolteam.id],
 *     authorizedWriterUsers: ["abc123"],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### With Mirrored Dashboards
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as signalfx from "@pulumi/signalfx";
 *
 * const mydashboardgroupWithmirrors = new signalfx.DashboardGroup("mydashboardgroupWithmirrors", {
 *     description: "Cool dashboard group",
 *     dashboards: [{
 *         dashboardId: signalfx_dashboard.gc_dashboard.id,
 *         nameOverride: "GC For My Service",
 *         descriptionOverride: "Garbage Collection dashboard maintained by JVM team",
 *         filterOverrides: [{
 *             property: "service",
 *             values: ["myservice"],
 *             negated: false,
 *         }],
 *         variableOverrides: [{
 *             property: "region",
 *             values: ["us-west1"],
 *             valuesSuggesteds: [
 *                 "us-west-1",
 *                 "us-east-1",
 *             ],
 *         }],
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
