/**
 * In the Splunk Observability Cloud web UI, a [dashboard group](https://developers.signalfx.com/dashboard_groups_reference.html) is a collection of dashboards.
 *
 * Dashboard groups cannot be accessed directly. You can access them through a dashboard within a group.
 *
 * > **NOTE** When you want to change or remove write permissions for a user other than yourself regarding dashboard groups, use a session token of an administrator to authenticate the Splunk Observability Cloud provider. See [Operations that require a session token for an administrator](https://dev.splunk.com/observability/docs/administration/authtokens#Operations-that-require-a-session-token-for-an-administrator).
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as signalfx from "@pulumi/signalfx";
 *
 * const mydashboardgroup0 = new signalfx.DashboardGroup("mydashboardgroup0", {
 *     name: "My team dashboard group",
 *     description: "Cool dashboard group",
 *     authorizedWriterTeams: [mycoolteam.id],
 *     authorizedWriterUsers: ["abc123"],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Example with permissions
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as signalfx from "@pulumi/signalfx";
 *
 * const mydashboardgroupWithpermissions = new signalfx.DashboardGroup("mydashboardgroup_withpermissions", {
 *     name: "My team dashboard group",
 *     description: "Cool dashboard group",
 *     permissions: [
 *         {
 *             principalId: "abc123",
 *             principalType: "ORG",
 *             actions: ["READ"],
 *         },
 *         {
 *             principalId: "abc456",
 *             principalType: "USER",
 *             actions: [
 *                 "READ",
 *                 "WRITE",
 *             ],
 *         },
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Example With mirrored dashboards
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as signalfx from "@pulumi/signalfx";
 *
 * const mydashboardgroupWithmirrors = new signalfx.DashboardGroup("mydashboardgroup_withmirrors", {
 *     name: "My team dashboard group",
 *     description: "Cool dashboard group",
 *     dashboards: [{
 *         dashboardId: gcDashboard.id,
 *         nameOverride: "GC For My Service",
 *         descriptionOverride: "Garbage Collection dashboard maintained by JVM team",
 *         filterOverrides: [{
 *             property: "service",
 *             values: ["myservice"],
 *             negated: false,
 *         }],
 *         variableOverrides: [{
 *             property: "region",
 *             values: ["us-west1"],
 *             valuesSuggesteds: [
 *                 "us-west-1",
 *                 "us-east-1",
 *             ],
 *         }],
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
