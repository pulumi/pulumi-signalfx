 * import * as signalfx from "@pulumi/signalfx";
 *
 * const awsServices = signalfx.aws.getServices({});
 * // Leaves out most of the integration bits, see the docs
 * // for signalfx_aws_integration for more
 * // â€¦
 * const awsMyteam = new signalfx.aws.Integration("awsMyteam", {services: [awsServices.then(awsServices => awsServices.services)].map(__item => __item?.name)});
